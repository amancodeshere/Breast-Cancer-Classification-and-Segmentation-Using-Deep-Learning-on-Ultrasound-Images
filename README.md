Problem Statement: 

  Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection
  plays a crucial role in reducing mortality rates and improving patient outcomes. Ultrasound imaging is a safe and
  widely used technique for breast cancer examination and early detection. However, the interpretation of ultrasound
  images can be challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to the complexity and variability of breast lesions.
  The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based system for accurate classification and segmentation of
  breast masses in ultrasound images. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and a comprehensive
  dataset of breast ultrasound images, this project aims to assist radiologists in the early detection and diagnosis of
  breast cancer, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of the screening process.

Task: 

  Develop a deep learning-based pipeline for breast cancer classification and segmentation using the Breast
  Ultrasound Dataset. Preprocess the ultrasound images, apply data augmentation techniques, and split the dataset into
  training, validation, and testing subsets. For the classification task, explore state-of-the-art deep learning architectures
  such as ResNet, DenseNet, or EfficientNet, and train a model to classify the images into normal, benign, and
  malignant categories. For the segmentation task, utilize semantic segmentation architectures like U-Net, DeepLab, or
  FCN, and train a model to accurately delineate the boundaries of breast masses in the ultrasound images.
